Alpha Vantage used to get IBM market flow data. This data represents every opening and closing of stock trading. Analyzing this information, could be very useful, because of it is shows how huge companies expand from stock trading

P.S. That project was a great expierience for me. I will remember those 2 nights for a long time. I expirienced everything:anger, helplessness, satisfaction, joy, despair, however, I did it and I think that I did well and the most of all, I want to believe that you will think so. Maybe you will not read this, but you are one of the best teachers in this university, with whom i learned a lot. Thank you❤️, D.B. With the best wishes...
